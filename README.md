DMDG Tool for One Time Pad encryption/decryption of comunication

DMDG  Digital Message Device Group

Basd on my backgorund in different special operations groups in the US Army, i have created a simple tool that is 100% 
secure and based on paper sheets of keys used for encryption/decryption (One Time Pads).  The best method of 
secure encrytpion is to install the tool on an old PC/Mac that has zero internet interaction and use a cheap 
USB thumb drive to manualy transfer encrypted files to and from a PC/Mac for transmit via email, IM or whatever. 
use a "day" key for a single message then burn that key by physicaly ripping the key
off the sheet and burning it to ash that can be ground to dust in the palm of your hand.

Use T base date methods of designation starting points in your list of keys.  For example, Agent 1 informs Agent 2 
in person that T = 3.  Then Agent 1 says to Agent 2, key T + 4, Agent 2 knows to start with Day 7.  Then you can 
place future instructons on T in the encrypted messages to keep a chat going.

Always guard your paper set of keys with your life.  

down load and edit the code as you see fit.  My goal is to add a hardware component for HAM radio comunication 
so its not limited to just the internet.
