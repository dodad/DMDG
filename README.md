DMDG Tool for One Time Pad encryption/decryption of comunication

DMDG  Digital Message Device Group

Based on my background in different special operations groups in the US Army, I have created a simple tool that is 100% 
secure and based on paper sheets of keys used for encryption/decryption (One Time Pads).  The best method of 
secure encrytpion is to install the tool on an old PC/Mac that has zero internet interaction and use a cheap 
USB thumb drive to manually transfer encrypted files to and from a PC/Mac for transmit via email, IM or whatever. 
Use a "T" key/code/compress set of values from the one time pad for a single message then burn that set of parameters
by physically ripping the values off the sheet and burning it to ash that can be ground to dust in the palm of your hand.

Use T base methods of designation for starting points in your list of keys.  For example, Agent 1 informs Agent 2 
in person that T = 3.  Then Agent 1 says to Agent 2 (in person), key T + 4, Agent 2 knows to start with T 7 from 
the one time pad.  Then you can place future instructions on T in the encrypted messages to keep a chat going.

Always guard your paper set of keys with your life.  

Down load and edit the code as you see fit.  My goal is to add a hardware component for HAM radio communication 
so it's not limited to just the internet.

The code is sloppy right now as it's a waterfall of ideas I play with on my commute to and from work. Once I get the help
files completed and some documentation ironed out, I will go back and clean up the code for better reuse of common
functions and naming standards.

All code is as is and free so don't complain :)
